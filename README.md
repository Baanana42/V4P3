# Safe?
Yes it is safe and tested by me, but as it is unfinished it maybe buggy at times.

# Details and History
It was cracked by Kangaroo Team but then it got striked and their servers were taken down.
But then Ape Team manage to re-create their servers and get it working again with config saving.
BUT THEN the Ape Crack stopped working for most people with newer versions of Python and other problems.
So I managed to fix the issue, by downloading and using the required pips seperately.
